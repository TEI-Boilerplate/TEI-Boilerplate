Change Log
==========

#1.2.0:

* Removed LESS in favor of plain CSS. This makes us completely dependency free

* Since there is no difference between the src/ and dist/ folders, dist/ has
  been removed

#1.1.0:

* Major rearrangement of folder structure. Development materials are now in src/
  and distribution is in dist/

* JavaScript has been completely rewritten to not use jQuery

#1.0.2:

* Now importing xml-to-string.xsl and using these routines to transform
  code in the TEI `<egXML>` element. This should affect only a small number
  of users who may be using TEI for technical documentation. Firefox
  does not support the `@disable-output-escaping` attribute, so the
  previous way we were handling `<egXML>` will not work in Firefox.

* Added CSS styles for syntax highlighting of XML code in egXML. This
  was made possible by the new routines for transforming egXML
  content.

* Other cosmetic tweaks to CSS.

#1.0.1:

* Fixed error in documentation (xsl-stylesheet processing instructions
  were incorrect).

#1.0.0:

* Initial Release
